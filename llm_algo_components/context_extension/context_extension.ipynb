    "LLM context length, or context window, is the maximum input length (number of tokens) that the model can process each time. It is the model's \"attention span,\" within which the model can pay attention to for generating the next token. In attention implementation, it is the parameter that usually named `seq_len` (or `max_seq_len`).\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are stateless. It is the context window that decides how much information we can give the model each time to get an output, which then decides what tasks the model can do for us. For example, is it able to process a couple of sentences/paragraphs, or a whole bunch of documents, or even entire books and code bases?\n",

    "The attention mechanism has quadratic complexity with regard to the context length (O(N^2)). Extending context length N means quickly increasing computation and memory costs. Therefore, efficient context extension is essential for both evaluation quality and system performance."
